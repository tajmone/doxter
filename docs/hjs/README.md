# Highlight.js

-   https://highlightjs.org
-   https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js

Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It works in the browser as well as on the server. It works with pretty much any markup, doesn't depend on any framework and has automatic language detection.

Since version 9.4.0 (2016-05-17), it includes PureBASIC syntax and theme files.

# PureBASIC & Highlight.js

I've created the PureBASIC syntax files for highlight.js:

-   https://github.com/tajmone/highlight.js

These are included in HLJS since v9.4.0.

There is also an unofficial “PureBASIC enhanced/modded release”, which emulates 100% the PureBASIC native IDE syntax coloring — maintained on a separate fork because it doesn't comply to the highlight.js guidelines:

-   [https://github.com/tajmone/highlight.js/tree/PureBASIC](https://github.com/tajmone/highlight.js/blob/PureBASIC/PureBASIC_README.md)
