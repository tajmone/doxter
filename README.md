# About Doxter

Doxter is a cross platform, fully standalone command line binary tool to generate AsciiDoc documentation from PureBasic, SpiderBasic or Alan source files.

Invoke Doxter by passing a source file of a supported language:

    > doxter myfile.pb

... Doxter will autodetect the language from its file extension, and it will create an AsciiDoc document from it, named `myfile.asciidoc` (or `myfile.ascidoc`).

It works its magic by a special notation in comments delimiters to markup tagged regions of text and code that should be extracted and exported to the AsciiDoc document.

```purebasic
;>even_macro
;| The following macro performs a bitwise AND operation to determine if an
;| integer is even or not.
Macro IsEven(num)
  (num & 1 = 0)  
EndMacro
;<
```

... in the output AsciiDoc document will become:

```adoc
// tag::even_macro[]
The following macro performs a bitwise AND operation to determine if an
integer is even or not.

[source,purebasic]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macro IsEven(num)
  (num & 1 = 0)  
EndMacro
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// end::even_macro[]
```

You can then selectively import tagged regions from the autogenerated doc into other documents, using [Asciidoctor's `include` directive][adr inc tag]: `include::myfile.asciidoc[tag=even_macro]`.
When documenting applications with modular design, you can selected regions from each module's doc file, and Doxter will automatically kept your documentation up to date.


You can optionally assign weights to regions, to control their order in the extracted document. Doxter sorts regions according to their tag's weight, before saving them to file.

```purebasic
;>even_macro(200)
;| The following macro performs a bitwise AND operation to determine if an
;| integer is even or not.
Macro IsEven(num)
  (num & 1 = 0)  
EndMacro
;<

;>macro_test(310)
;| Let's test that the macro actually works as expected.
For i = 1 To 5
  If isEven(i)
    Debug Str(i) +" is even."
  Else
    Debug Str(i) +" is odd."
  EndIf
Next
;<

;>even_macro_intro(100)
;| === The IsEven Macro
;| 
;| Using bitwise operations insted of modulo (`%`) is much _much_ faster -- in
;| the order of hundreds of times faster! 
;<
;>even_macro_explain(300)
;| This works because `IsEven = ((i % 2) = 0)` equals `IsEven = ((i & 1) = 0)`.
;<
```

In the final document the regions will be sorted in this order:

```adoc
// tag::even_macro_intro[]
=== The IsEven Macro

Using bitwise operations insted of modulo (`%`) is much _much_ faster -- in
the order of hundreds of times faster! 
// end::even_macro_intro[]

// tag::even_macro[]
The following macro performs a bitwise AND operation to determine if an
integer is even or not.

[source,purebasic]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macro IsEven(num)
  (num & 1 = 0)  
EndMacro
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// end::even_macro[]

// tag::even_macro_explain[]
This works because `IsEven = ((i % 2) = 0)` equals `IsEven = ((i & 1) = 0)`.
// end::even_macro_explain[]

// tag::macro_test[]
Let's test that the macro actually works as expected.

[source,purebasic]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For i = 1 To 5
  If isEven(i)
    Debug Str(i) +" is even."
  Else
    Debug Str(i) +" is odd."
  EndIf
Next
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// end::macro_test[]
```

# Acknowledgements

Although quite different in design, Doxter was inspired by Lou Acresti’s [Cod], an unassuming doc format (_Documentus modestus_)  —  the simplicity of Cod sparkled the idea that I could implement something similar, but exploiting AsciiDoc tagged regions instead.

My gratitude to [Lou Acresti] (aka [@namuol]) for having created such an inspiring tool like Cod.
