== Doxter Changelog

Changelog of Doxter command line application.

* *v0.2.5-alpha* (2018/11/29) -- Documentation outsourcing:
  Move to external AsciiDoc files the documentation regions that are not strictly
  commenting parts of the source code:
** Move `CHANGELOG` region to `CHANGELOG.adoc`.
** Move to `README.adoc` the following commented regions:
  `Acknowledgements`, `Roadmap`.

--
The goal is to keep the source files shorter and that doxtering each source module
will produce a reference document strictly focusing on the module technicalities.

From now on, Doxter documentation will be handled in external AsciiDoc files that
will then import from the doxterized sources the relevant tagged regions.
Since the documentation is starting to grow larger, this approach is more flexible
and allows reusing the same regions contents in multiple documents.
--

* *v0.2.4-alpha* (2018/11/25) -- Engine optimizations:
** The engine code has been slightly optimized to improve performance and
   code maintainability.

* *v0.2.3-alpha* (2018/10/11) -- BUG FIX:
** Read Alan sources as ISO-8859-1. Add `dox::fileEnconding` var to allow
   setting file read operations for Alan sources to Ascii and avoid breaking
   special characters that were being read as if encoded in UTF-8.

* *v0.2.2-alpha* (2018/10/11) -- BUG FIX:
** Corrupted filenames. A bug was corrupting output filenames of Alan source
   files with `.i` extension. Now fixed.

* *v0.2.1-alpha* (2018/10/10) -- Add Alan IF support.
** Now Doxter will detect from the input file's extension whether it's a
   PureBasic, SpiderBasic or Alan IF source file, and set the comment delimiter
   and base language (to use in ADoc source blocks) accordingly.
** The supported extensions, and associated languages now are:
*** `pb`, `pbi`, `pbf` -> PureBasic
*** `sb`, `sbi`, `sbf` -> SpiderBasic
*** `alan`, `i`        -> Alan

* *v0.2.0-alpha* (2018/10/03) -- Move Doxter Engine to separate module:
** Now the core engine of Doxter is in a separate module, so that it will be
   usable by other applications too (still needs some fixes to be usable in
   non-console applications).

* *v0.1.4-alpha* (2018/10/01) -- Documentation:
** AsciiDoc examples now syntax highlighted.

* *v0.1.3-alpha* (2018/09/29) -- Doxter engine improved:
** PureBasic special comments markers (`;{`, `;}` and `;-`) can now be used
   in all Doxter markers, except ADoc Header (`;=`).
** Regions merging feature introduced:
*** Tagged regions with same tag identifier are merged into a single region
     in the output document:
**** All region fragments will be sorted by subweight before merging.
*** Region subweight:
**** New subweight parameter (optional) introduced in Region Begin marker,
     (e.g. `;>tag(100.99`)` or `;>(.99)`, where subweight is `99`).
**** If the marker doesn't provide a subweight, the last subweight value used
     with that tag will be automatically employed after incrementing it by 1.
*** When a weightless Region Begin marker is encountered, if a region with
    the same tag already exists, that region's weight will be used for the
    new region fragment, otherwise it will be given weight 1.
*** If multiple weight definitions are given for a same region tag, the last
    one encountered will override the previous ones.
** Parsing Live Preview now shows subweight in new third column.

* *v0.1.2-alpha* (2018/09/25) -- Aesthetic changes.

* *v0.1.1-alpha* (2018/09/25) -- Created Doxter repository on GitHub.

* *v0.1.0-alpha* (2018/09/21) -- First public released Alpha:

Changelog of Doxter engine module.

* *v0.0.5-alpha* (2018/11/29) -- Documentation outsourcing:
  Move to external AsciiDoc files the documentation regions that are not strictly
  commenting the Engine and its API.
** Move `CHANGELOG` region to `CHANGELOG.adoc`.

* *v0.0.4-alpha* (2018/11/25) -- Engine optimizations:
** The engine code has been slightly optimized to improve performance and
   code maintainability:
*** Reduced the number of RegExs used by the engine by optimizing reusability.
*** Source lines parsing has been optimized in both the Header Parser and the
    Regions Parser.
*** Deleted internal procedures:
**** `IsAdocComment()`
**** `IsSkipComment()`
**** `StripCommentLine()`

* *v0.0.3-alpha* (2018/10/11) -- BUG FIX: Read Alan sources as ISO-8859-1:
** Add `fileEnconding` var to allow setting file read operations for Alan
   sources to Ascii (`#PB_Ascii`) to avoid breaking special characters that
   were being read as if encoded in UTF-8.

* *v0.0.2-alpha* (2018/10/10) -- Add support for Alan language, and improve
  SpiderBasic support:
** The Engine now exposes a `dox::SetEngineLang(lang.s)` procedure to allow
   setting the comment delimiter and the language of source blocks according
   to the selected language (`"PureBasic"`, `"SpiderBasic"` or `"Alan"`).

* *v0.0.1-alpha* (2018/10/03) -- First module engine release.
